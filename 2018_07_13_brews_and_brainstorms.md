Re: Knoxville's Open Data Initiative

KnoxData - a local data science meetup group underneath the KnoxDevs umbrella - met with some
members Friday, `2018-07-13` , to discuss civic data of interest in an effort to formulate what data types
should be looked at first during the Open Data Sprints set to begin in August.
Following discussion, some votes were placed (but not entirely done) to give a sense of some priority to
release. Below is a table of all of the ideas that were generated. It is likely a few are of datasets that do not
exist (intriguing ideas for future ways to collect such data) or datasets that may prove too sensitive to
release. Some idea of data availability is provided (based on internal surveys), as well as highlighting some
datasets that might be sensitive.



### Datasets of Interest

Below is a listing of all ideas generated
